# Jenkins Pipelines

This repository contains Jenkins pipeline examples for automating software build, test, and deployment processes. Jenkins is an open-source automation server widely used for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the Jenkins pipeline defined in this repository, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)
- Git (for version control)
- Docker (if using Docker-based builds)
- A version control system (e.g., GitHub) with access to your source code repositories

## How to Use This Repository

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saideepthi422/jenkins-pipelines.git
cd jenkins-pipelines
```
### Step 2: Configure Jenkins

Install the Pipeline plugin in Jenkins if not already installed.

Set up Jenkins jobs using Jenkinsfile from this repository. The Jenkins pipeline configuration is defined in the Jenkinsfile.

### Basic steps to add Jenkinsfile to Jenkins:

1. In Jenkins, create a new item and choose Pipeline.

2. Under Pipeline section, choose Pipeline script from SCM.

3. Select Git and enter the repository URL (https://github.com/saideepthi422/jenkins-pipelines.git).

4. Specify the branch (e.g., main) and the path to the Jenkinsfile (Jenkinsfile).

### Step 3: Customize the Pipeline
You can modify the Jenkinsfile to suit your project's needs, such as:

- Defining build steps (e.g., compile, test, package).

- Configuring deployment steps.

- Adding additional tools (e.g., Docker, Maven, Gradle).

### Step 4: Run the Pipeline
Once you have configured Jenkins to use the Jenkinsfile, simply trigger the job to run the pipeline and start the CI/CD process.

### Example Jenkinsfile
Here's an example of what the Jenkinsfile might look like:

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
                // Add build steps here (e.g., Maven, Gradle, etc.)
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing...'
                // Add test steps here (e.g., running unit tests)
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying...'
                // Add deploy steps here (e.g., deploying to AWS, Kubernetes, etc.)
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        always {
            echo 'Pipeline completed'
        }
    }
}

### Step 5: Troubleshooting
If the pipeline fails at any step, Jenkins will provide logs that can help debug the issue. Common problems can include:

- Incorrect paths to source code or resources.

- Missing dependencies.

- Misconfigured environment variables.

## Conclusion
This repository is a starting point for creating automated Jenkins pipelines for your projects. You can easily extend and modify the pipelines to suit your application requirements.
